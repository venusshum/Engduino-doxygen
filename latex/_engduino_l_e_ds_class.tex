The Engduino has 16 L\+E\+Ds with independent red, green and blue channels. The L\+E\+D driver is used to set the colour and brightness of the L\+E\+Ds

\begin{DoxyNote}{Note}
The Arduino Print class uses character at a time writes so it was necessary to use a \hyperlink{class_engduino_accelerometer_class}{The Engduino L\+E\+D Documentation } function to control when data is written to the S\+D card.
